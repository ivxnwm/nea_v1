This is my computer science NEA project, a web app for revision. Right now only A level Further Maths is available, with the prospect of having more subjects in the future.

You can access it [online](https://blueberrevise.streamlit.app) or run on a local machine, with having the Streamlit library installed:

```$ streamlit run https://github.com/ivxnwm/nea_v1/blob/32d1f2eb72f1b605eddf00bbbbd029cb8f9e3be7/streamlit_app.py```

The `documentation` directory contains the code necessary for the maintenance of the app, e.g. to update the database to add new questions or subjects.
