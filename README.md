This is my computer science NEA project, a web app for revision. Right now only A level Maths is available, with the prospect of having more subjects in future!

To run on a local machine use, with having the Streamlit library installed,

```$ streamlit run https://github.com/ivxnwm/nea_v1/blob/32d1f2eb72f1b605eddf00bbbbd029cb8f9e3be7/streamlit_app.py```
